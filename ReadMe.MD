Functions that i have to make:

1. *create_node(value)*: This function creates a new node with the given value and initializes its left and right children to None.
2. *insert(root, value)*: This function inserts a new value into the AVL tree rooted at 'root'. It should return the updated root of the subtree.
3. *delete(root, value)*: This function deletes a node with the given value from the AVL tree rooted at 'root'. It should return the updated root of the subtree.
4. *search(root, value)*: This function searches for a value in the AVL tree rooted at 'root'. It should return True if the value is found, False otherwise.
5. *get_height(node)*: This function returns the height of the node. If the node is None, the height is considered to be 0.
